#### How our PayMaster works?

By decoupling gas fees from users, paymasters facilitate smoother onboarding, especially for newcomers, and enable more complex transaction scenarios, such as those involving meta-transactions. Currently our pay master works on PBK token which is cw20 base token but we will be extending it to work with any token of user's choice.
